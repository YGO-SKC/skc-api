## Supreme Kings Castle (SKC)
SKC is the **best** YuGiOh database. It offers players a fast and free interface to find cards, products, and ban list information.

This GitHub Repo contains the API portion of SKC. It is used by the website to interface with the Database. 

**Note:** A Suggestion Engine is being built and will be a new API. Links will be provided later :)  

## "Hey Can I Use Your API For...?"
Short answer - maybe.

I understand that developers who are starting out with Web API's can struggle a bit. As such, any developer who is just learning about REST can use my API to get a feel for the spec. 

Teachers and/or instructors can also use the API for demonstration.

However, since it takes time to build a robust Database from scratch alone in a room, usage of the API is not allowed for commercial use.

Essentially, if you want to learn about computers/CS/coding/etc and need random data/ random service to call, use the API! If you want to make money, build your own. I cannot afford to offset other peoples traffic on my servers :(

## Contributions
### Developers
Developers can help by creating Git Issues on bugs/feature requests/etc.

Currently, I do not need extra hands and have no way of paying people. Making it a full open source project is also something I do not plan on doing because it can quickly deter from my vision.

The Source code is public so other developers can critique it. 

### Others
This is an unfunded project. In other words, there is no Crowd Funding offering you perks in vain attempt to take your money.

This means that everything is coming out of my pocket. There are ways of donating via Paypal/BTC BUT that should only be done by users who use the service frequently AND find value in it. There are no perks in donating. You will also have to find how to donate on your own.

I am also offering the community more content. Check out the links for my YouTube channel and subscribe to support the project by watching my videos.

In summary, I am trying to provide a free, non-add supported, fast and clean service for everyone and am finding unconventional ways of funding it. Along the way, I am providing not only the service, but entertainment. Now how many "Yugi Tubers" can say that?
